# AMSE/SAKI 2023: A Course on **Data Engineering**

This repository is part of the university course "Advanced Software Methods / Software Applications with AI" at the FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg. It contains all the necessary files and submissions pertaining to the exercises as well as the final project for this course.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `.github`: Contains workflow configuration files for CI/CD and feedback on the exercises.
- `exercises`: Contains all exercise submissions for the course. Each exercise involves the creation of a data engineering pipeline for a different dataset. Exercise files are named as "exercise<number>.jv" or "exercise<number>.py", depending on the programming language used.
- `project`: Contains all the files related to the project. This includes the project plan, report, slides, Python notebooks for data exploration and analysis, and scripts for data engineering.

## Exercises

All submissions for exercises are located in the `exercises` folder. These exercises involve building data engineering pipelines for different datasets using [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Jayvee](https://github.com/jvalue/jayvee), a programming language developed at this university specifically for data engineering. Each submission is a file named as "exercise<number>.jv" or "exercise<number>.py" depending on the language used for the exercise.

## Project Work

The `project` directory contains all files pertaining to the final project. This project is a self-organized data science project developed over the course of the semester. The project is based on at least two different open data sources, one of which must be from Mobilithek.

In this project, I analyzed bicycle traffic in the city of Münster, Germany, using various open data sources. I leveraged Python for data exploration and analysis and developed a data engineering pipeline to process and transform the data. The result of the project includes Python notebooks for data exploration and analysis (`data_analysis.ipynb`), and scripts for data engineering in the `data` directory.

The final report of the project, which provides a comprehensive insight into the methodologies, data sources, challenges faced, and results obtained, can be found in `project/report.pdf`. The project presentation slides are available in `project/slides.pdf`.
